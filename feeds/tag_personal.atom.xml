&lt;a href="https://br.linkedin.com/in/lucas-eustaquio-gomes-da-silva-16522816"&gt;Lucas Eustaquio Gomes da Silva&lt;/a&gt;,
our Senior Data Scientist since August 2013, has passed away after a brave battle against an aggressive form of 
&lt;a href="http://kickingcancerass.blogspot.com.br/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our deepest condolences to his family, which are in our thoughts in this moment of pain and mourning.
The funeral service will be held in &lt;a href="http://www.bosqueesperanca.com.br/"&gt;Belo Horizonte&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow, April 25th, 
at 10am BRT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucas was a fun, brilliant, confident and hard-working man. We are thankful for the time we had to
work with and learn from him, and are truly saddened by how tragically short that time was. Today the 
world loses an amazing human being, and one of its 
&lt;a href="http://blog.kaggle.com/2016/02/22/profiling-top-kagglers-leustagos-current-7-highest-1/"&gt;most talented data scientists&lt;/a&gt;,
which was respected and cherished by his 
&lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/forums/f/15/kaggle-forum/t/20388/data-scientist-hero"&gt;colleagues and peers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rest in peace, Lucas. You will be missed. We will do our best to ensure your work lives on - that the dream
you shared with us will be realized, whatever the odds.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Personal"></category><category term="personal"></category></entry></feed>
